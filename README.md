# Clinic-management-system

Clinic Project Created as a part of "Operating Systems" course.

This program shows the use of semaphore, threads, multithreading, linked lists in UNIX based environment and C.

There is a clinic with 3 dentals, each of them can only serve one patient (only 3 patiens can get treatment at the same time) 

The waiting room includes maximum of 10 patients, 4 sofas - so we have a queue of patients who wait to be sitted according to their arrival time,  as well as a queue for the standing patients

Only 1 patient can pay for the service at a time and one of the three dentals has to be free to take he's payment.

An example for output:
